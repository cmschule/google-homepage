# google-homepage
My first project from the odin project.  
Project Name: google-homepage  
http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css?ref=lnav  
  
The html and css is all over the place, knees weak, mom's spaghetti. This is my first couple of html/css pages that I've worked on, and I'm pretty clueless at this point about the best practices of web developing.  I churned these out with no intention of reuse or code coherence, only with how it appeared in my firefox browser. This was an exercise used as practice and hopefully will be a good reference in the next few months to demonstrate how much I have improved.  Cheers.
